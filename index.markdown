## Welcome to FireBreathingStickers.com!

**Born on May 17, 2024, from the fiery imagination of a father and son duo, FireBreathingStickers.com started with a laugh-filled drive through Perryville, Maryland.**

It all began when Aaron and Mozzie were transporting a van full of IKEA goods to their new home in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. A hissing goose (did it have red eyes!?), seemingly breathing fire, sparked endless ideas and laughter on their journey. This unforgettable trip birthed the whimsical world of FireBreathingStickers, where random things breathe fire, and sometimes even rainbows!
